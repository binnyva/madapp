<h1>Fixing Invalid Login Issue</h1>

<p>Go to <a href="http://makeadiff.in/madapp/index.php/user/search_email">http://makeadiff.in/madapp/index.php/user/search_email</a></p>

<p>This is a top secret page that no one knows of. Only people with high permissions can access it.</p>

<p><strong>Enter the email ID</strong> of the person that has the problem - click Search.</p>

<h3 id="sit-1">Situation 1: Person found.</h3>

<p>Click on the name of the person - will take you to a separate page. Click on the edit button at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>Make sure they <strong>have user type 'Volunteer'</strong>. Set their <strong>passwords to 'pass'</strong>. Ask the person to try logging in again. Nine times out of ten, this will work.</p>

<h3>Situation 2: Person with given email ID not found.</h3>

<p>This means <strong>they haven't been assigned their new ID</strong> yet. Ask them for their <strong>old email ID</strong> - the ID they were using last year.</p>

<p>Search for that email id in the same search page. Edit this person you find, change his email id to the new one, and follow the same instructions as <a href="#sit-1">Situation 1</a>.</p>

<p>If the person is not even found using their old email id, ask for their phone number and search using that. If you find the person, follow the same instructions again.</p>

<p>If person still not found, we have bigger issues. Escalate the problem to the tech team. They have super powers. They are the only ones who can save you now. </p>
